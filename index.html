                  is
                  a teen crisis hotline from Boys Town that focuses on helping teens when they need it most. Originating
                  with
                  call, chat, and email support they soon expanded to include texting and a mobile app to better
                  communicate with today's teens. In 2018, the Hotline helped over 52,000 teens with issues relating to
                  suicide, relationships, mental health, and more.</p>

              <h5 class="has-text-secondary">Faster content creation with the Bulma framework</h5
                class="has-text-secondary">
              <p class="spacer-bottom--xl">Hand-crafting every line of your CSS is ideal but your CSS also shouldn't
                waste your time. We were writing new styles
                for
                every minor
                design change because our CSS wasn't reusable. Adding the <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank"
                  rel="noopener">Bulma CSS framework</a> into the site
                during
                the
                rebuild
                resulted in <span class="has-text-weight-bold">less custom SCSS partials</span> to maintain and more
                design flexibility. Bulma was chosen for its lack of JavaScript dependencies and the ability to <span
                  class="has-text-weight-bold">import only the pieces of it that we found useful</span>, allowing us
                reusable styles without the bulk of some other frameworks.</p>
              <h5 class="has-text-secondary">Increasing load speed with npm build tools</h5>

              <p>Websites need small, compressed files for fast
                load
                times but without a build system in place you can't guarantee that compression is being done
                consistently
                or
                at
                all. To make this task easy and consistent I wrote a build
                system
                with
                npm
                scripts.</p>
              <p class="spacer-bottom--xl">The build system <span class="has-text-weight-bold">uses packages like
                  node-sass,
                  autoprefixer,
                  babel,
                  browserify, and uglify-js</span> to take care of converting SCSS files to CSS and creating
                minified
                bundles of our JavaScript files. Editing CSS and JavaScript files
                are
                still
                as
                easy as opening a file, editing, and saving but we are consistently minifying our code no matter who
                works on it.
                Instead of loading two or three style sheets and up to five
                JavaScript
                files,
                we
                load one style sheet and one JavaScript bundle.</p>
              <h5 class="has-text-secondary">New 'Tips &amp; Tools' section for more organized support and better
                site
                exploration</h5>

              <p>The Hotline has over 150 tips and tools on their site which used to be listed
                out
                on a single page; not a user friendly
                experience. After meeting with the Hotline we agreed that categories would make it easy for teens and
                kids
                to
                find
                what
                they were looking for.</p>
              <p>We called the categories "topics" and created a new page for each. <span
                  class="has-text-weight-bold">Each
                  topic page has a featured tip and a listing of all the tips and tools related to that
                  topic.</span>
                We
                added
                photos and short descriptions to each tip to help them decide what tips they would be interested
                in.
                Lastly,
                because one tip may fall under many topics, we made it possible for each tip to appear in as many
                topics
                as
                needed. After clicking a tip, you can <span class="has-text-weight-bold">see all of the related tips and
                  tools
                  in the side navigation</span> making it easy to stay on topic and find what you need.</p>
              <p>All of these topic pages are set up using search to automatically pull in the necessary tips and
                tools

              <h4>Noteworthy Projects</h4>
              <h5 class="has-text-secondary">Adding cross-site publishing systems to eliminate duplicate content
                creation</h5>
              <p>Boys Town National Research Hospital has two primary sites, one geared toward the main hospital and the
                other focused on pediatrics. The designs of the sites had not been updated in quite a while and they
                were
                looking for a refresh that better allowed patients to find the services and physicians that they needed.
                As part of this redesign a cross-site publishing system was also suggested since the sites share some of
                their content; particularly locations, physicians, and knowledge center articles.</p>
              <p class="spacer-bottom--xl">Starting with the cross-site publishing system we poured through all of the
                data needed for each section
                of the site and worked through how best to connect and manage it all. The physicians, services,
                locations,
                and knowledge center articles in particular all have links to each other and those connections needed to
                be managed carefully so any changes were populated correctly throughout the site. For example, if a
                location changed their address that address needed to be updated and correct on the location page, the
                services pages, and the physician pages. The goal was to update the address in one spot and have that
                update be reflected in all the areas. With a lot of planning on the setup of the content we were able to
                successfully create a system that allows the content to be kept in sync throughout the site.</p>
              <h5 class="has-text-secondary">Redesign of the sites</h5>
              <p>With the content in order next up was building the sites with the new design. The building step was
                much
                the same as other sites; a custom master page, some page layouts, JavaScript for some functionality, and
                custom CSS with the Bulma framework behind it. The trickiest part of this website was presenting the
                content. Since much of the content was shared between the two sites the content is stored in one place
                and
                the sites present the content using search web parts. The page layouts and search web parts needed to be
                built so that they presented the shared content the same on both sites, and in the cases that the
                content
                was different, show only the content for that particular site. The page layouts use special search web
                parts that look at the URL or the term tagged to the page to correctly bring in the data for each page
                creating a very dynamic setup.</p>
              <p>Working with all that interconnected content and setting up the cross-site publishing was quite an
                undertaking but it resulted in a much easier system to manage the content between the two sites.
                Updating
                the content requires very little to no HTML or CSS knowledge allowing for more than just web people to
                update the sites. Armed with an advanced shared content setup and a new design that better allows
                visitors
                to find the physicians and services that are right for them, Boys Town National Research Hospital is
                poised to attract new patients and better serve their existing ones.</p>

            <h4>Opportunities moving forward</h4>
            <p>Moving the build process for the CSS and JavaScript into npm scripts instead of CodeKit. CodeKit is a
              good product that we were using early on, but since we started using npm scripts on the other sites it
              would be ideal to covert this site to using a similar process for consistency and more control of the
              code.</p>

                class="has-text-secondary">
              <p>(Completed while working remotely)</p>
              <p>Boys Town's website was previously built by an outside vendor using Drupal but the decision was made to
                move the website in-house. This meant a conversion from Drupal to our SharePoint systems. It was
                important
                that the design remain exactly the same and for the project to be completed before the centennial
                anniversary beginning in 2017.</p>
              <p>We used a tool to move the content from the pages into our SharePoint site so the majority of the work
                was building the site from scratch in SharePoint. I looked through the site in sections evaluating what
                pages were similar enough that would allow me to build a page layout for them, ensuring that they were
                all
                built the same every time a new page was created. Pages that did not fit into one of these layouts were
                compared to determine what "generic" page layouts could be built that most of the pages would be able to
                use.</p>
              <p>The CSS and JavaScript were all re-coded from scratch to mesh with SharePoint's CSS and the company's
                guidelines for coding. No framework was used at the time seeing as we had not made the decision to start
                building sites using frameworks at that point.</p>
              <p>It was a large project and the company's flagship website so everything had to be perfect. Even working
                remotely, we completed the project on time and went live exactly as scheduled. Every new launch has a
                few
                bugs here and there, but the site was thoroughly checked before go live so the bugs were kept at
                minimum. The project was very successful and everyone was happy with the results.</p>

            <p>Adding a CSS framework to the site and implementing a design system. Over the years the site has become
              disorganized and inconsistent when it comes to both code and design. Adding these two items would help the
              code remain clean into the future and allow for faster develop of new pages by using a design system to
              assist
              in the creative process. The design system would also mitigate any rouge CSS being written since we would
              be sticking to approved design aspects and CSS.</p>
